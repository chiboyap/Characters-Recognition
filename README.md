# Characters-Recognition

View report.pdf for more infos on the implementation 

Unicredit asked to you to provide them a software that given a scanned picture with a character (i.e, a,A,B,B,...) is able to recognize:
The font 
The character 
If it is in bold
If it is in italics

For Example:
A       â‡’       (Amatic, A, 1, 1)
Thus, your goal is to provide Unicredit a PoC (Proof of Concept) that your model works properly. In particular, these are the required deliverables:
The model (that is going to be secretly tested)
A document (max length 2 pages) that describes your model and the choices you took during its development.
